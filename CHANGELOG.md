[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added

- **Export as PDF** (File → Export as PDF…, ⇧⌘E): renders the document through the
  HTML renderer into a paginated A4 PDF, styled on the design-system tokens.
- **Check for Updates** (Marginal → Check for Updates…): compares the running version
  against the newest GitHub release — and can now download and install the update
  itself. The app quits, a small script swaps in the new version, and it relaunches.
- **Line-number gutter**: a sidebar a tad lighter than the paper shows the caret's
  line number, very faintly, aligned with the caret's own line — and nothing at all
  when the cursor isn't in the text.
- **Status bar**: the markdown context at the cursor as a breadcrumb ("h1 › bold")
  plus the position ("L 24 · C 13").

### Changed

- The whole app now follows the design-system token sheet: warm paper page, violet
  accent (inline code, links, checked task boxes), warm syntax-highlight palette,
  hairline table grids, violet-tinted selection.
- Bold renders at semibold (600) — the product's heaviest weight; 700 no longer
  appears anywhere.
- Base type size is 16px (headings scale 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.875 from it).
- App icon updated to the icon-3 mark.

### Fixed

- Swift 6 strict-concurrency crashes-in-waiting: main-actor isolation for the app
  delegate, document storage, and the PDF print callback (which fires on a
  background thread).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added

- First tagged release: true-WYSIWYG markdown editing with reveal-at-cursor syntax,
  Notion-grade rendering (tables, code cards, task lists, auto-renumbered ordered
  lists, blockquotes, emoji shortcodes), plain `.md` files, native AppKit app with
  macOS tabs (⌘1–⌘9), copy as Markdown or HTML, light and dark mode.
